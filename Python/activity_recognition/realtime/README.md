- A simple demo of a real time activity recogntion applacation. 
- Raw hexadecimal triaxial accelerometer data are sent to PC via SOCKET.
- While the data are received then decode the received hexadecimal triaxial accelerometer data to decimal data and draw the wave pattern.
- Predict the decoded accelerometer data by a pre-trained machine learning model and show the predicted label of received data in one graph in real time.
